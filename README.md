# The Odin Project- Ruby on Rails
## Project 2- Members Only!

This project is part of the Ruby on Rails 'Authentication' section of 'The Odin Project'.

The goal of this project is to build an exclusive clubhouse where members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
